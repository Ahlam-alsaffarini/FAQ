## Overview

### The challenge

This a challenge for build faq accordion card which user should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When I first started learning JavaScript it used to be very a hard to understand how to interact with DOM elements. With time, it's getting much easier and I am happy to practice it one more time!

yeah it's still some of my working on proj not a professional ,but i hope in future to become stronger and more creative in writing codes ^-^
